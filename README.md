# Selenium-Intro

- My first automated test scripts using Selenium are written in JavaScript.
- I'm beginning with simple test cases, exploring the tool's methods.
- I will keep increasing difficulty by creating more complex test cases.

## Focus:

- Will start mapping the test pages.
- Test more with less. 
- More complex workflows. 
- Assertions are mandatory. 

## Aditional Info: 

- The current project is using Chai and Mocha frameworks.
- Added mochaweomse reporter. 
- mochawesome-report added to .gitignore.
